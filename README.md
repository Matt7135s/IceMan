# IceMan (Matt7135s Copy)
This was a class project. I collaborated on a two-person team to implement a fully playable 2D arcade-style game loosely based on Digger (1983), using prebuilt game assets and skeleton code for engine setup. The prebuilt game assets and skeleton code are not included in this repository, as we were working from two different operating systems with unique skeleton code. Together, we designed the overall game logic system including object class hierarchies and major gameplay components. I was primarily responcible for implementing procedural level generation, scoring mechanics, and non-player character behavior. We debugged and tested gameplay mechanics extensively to ensure stability and correct functionality across multiple levels. This project was completed and received a perfect grade.
